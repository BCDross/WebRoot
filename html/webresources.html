    <h1>Web Resources</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><p id="a"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br />
        W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know in order to author good web pages.
        This is valuable because there are a lot of tutorials and examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, and Node.
        Anyone working on the web will find this a valuable resource for authoring web apps. I can use this site as a resource to look up the 
        things I need as well as working through tutorials to learn new things, as well as refreshing what I have forgotten.

      <li><p id="b"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Net Web Docs</a><br />
        Tools, tutorials and information about coding for browsers. Largely geared towards the Mozilla Firefox browser, but also an excellent resource for the JavaScript Language and other cross platform information.<br />

      <li><p id="c"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com">Microsoft Docs</a><br />
        Microsoft Online Documentation Library is a great resource for all things microsoft. .Net, ASP.NET, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, MS SQL, T-SQL, Visual Studio, C#, and all other languages documentation is here and publicly viewable.
        This is an extremely useful resource for anyone working on any of these languages or with these products. From Administrating product servers to tutorials to teach you how to code in the languages. This is a extensive repository of information.

      <li><p id="d"><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a><br />
        Stack Overflow is a forum like repository where users can post technical questions and other professionals can post answers and assist with your issue as well as educate you on how to avoid it in the future. This is great because you tend to get your code
        actually looked at and feedback on it. And in my experience, people are generally not rude about things, since everyone is here for the same reason, better coding.

      <li><p id="e"><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a><br />
        Free Code Camp(FCC) is a great resource for a variety of reasons. Their tutorials are all available freely. The source code for the site is also viewable on github. The tutorials are broken up into bite size pieces but are both extensive and deep in their
        presentation. You really do get to understand the material from this.<br/>

      <li><p id="f"><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a><br />
        YouTube is actually a fantastic resource for tutorials and learning new things. The amount of content creators out there for tutorials on all programming and technical skills is vast. There are generally many people doing the tutorials for the same thing,
        but this helps you because you can find one that fits your learning style. Some are much faster, and some are much slower. Just be critical of the tutorial and you will find one that works for you.
